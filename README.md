# Clothing Shop Marketplace

A sleek and modern **clothing shop** built as part of the [NameName Marketplace](https://namename-store.onrender.com/).  
This project showcases a fully functional clothing store, developed using **React** and customized from Sharetribe's bike shop web template.  

The marketplace aimed to provide a platform for **undiscovered brands** to showcase and sell their clothing, with NameName earning a commission on each sale.
