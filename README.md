# Clothing Shop Marketplace

A sleek and modern **clothing shop** built for [NameName Marketplace](https://www.instagram.com/namenamestore/).  
This project showcases a fully functional clothing store, developed using **React** and customized from Sharetribe's bike shop web template.  

While the project is no longer operational, you can access the demo here: [NameName Store](https://namename-store.onrender.com/).

The marketplace was designed to provide a platform for **undiscovered brands** to showcase and sell their clothing, with NameName earning a commission on each sale.
