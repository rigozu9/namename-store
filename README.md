# Clothing Shop Marketplace

A sleek and modern **clothing shop** built for [NameName Marketplace](https://www.instagram.com/namenamestore/).  
This project showcases a fully functional clothing store, developed using **React** and customized from Sharetribe's bike shop web template. Template provided by [Sharetribe](https://www.sharetribe.com/rental-marketplace/). 

While the project is no longer operational, you can access the demo here: [NameName Store](https://namename-store.onrender.com/). 

The full project is hosted in a **private GitHub repository**, but I’m happy to share it privately upon request. Feel free to reach out if you’d like a closer look or have any questions about the project!

The marketplace was designed to provide a platform for **undiscovered brands** to showcase and sell their clothing, with NameName earning a commission on each sale.
